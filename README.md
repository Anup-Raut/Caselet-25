🔹 Caselet’25: The Ultimate Case Study Challenge

🔸 Team BlueLock – Bajaj Institute of Technology, Wardha

📘 Project Overview
This project provides a SQL-driven inventory monitoring and optimization system for Urban Retail Co., targeting inventory inefficiencies using historical sales and stock data. The objective is to optimize stock levels, forecast demand, and reduce stockouts, thereby enabling data-driven supply chain management.

🎯 Objectives
Minimize stockouts and overstocking

Forecast demand and identify low inventory

Improve inventory turnover and supplier efficiency

📊 Frameworks Applied
🔸 1. Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
Focused on top 20% SKUs responsible for 80% of sales

Prioritized inventory action based on product movement

🔸 2. McKinsey 7S Framework

📈 KPI Dashboard
KPI	Insight
Avg. Stock Level	Identifies overstock risk
Low Inventory Incidents	Spot critical SKUs needing attention
Reorder Point	Forecast-based restocking trigger
Turnover Ratio	Measures inventory movement efficiency
Stockout Rate	Tracks product unavailability impact
Fast/Slow Movers	Prioritize top-performing SKUs for planning

🧠 Strategic Recommendations
Differentiated Inventory Policy: JIT for fast-movers, periodic for slow SKUs

Reorder Automation: Based on dynamic thresholds

Safety Stock Buffers: To prevent high-risk stockouts

SKU Rationalization: Eliminate or bundle underperforming products

Store-Level Alerts: Targeted interventions for low-stock locations
